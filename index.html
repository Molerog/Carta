<h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
Dear Eileen,

Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part </br >
of your <u>PhD</u> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.

<h2>Starting dates</h2>
We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you </br > 
could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
  <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
  <li>Third semester 2 May 2017</li>
</ul>
Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer.</br ></br >
You can find more information about <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/">important university dates </a> on our website.
<h2>Subjects of study</h2>
At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall </br >
somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just </br >
the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued </br >
by are as follows, in order of priority:
<ol>
  <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
  <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the </br > 
      audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
  <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol>
So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the </br >
research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
<h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, </br > 
my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
<dl>
  <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
    <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance </br >
        around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.</dd>
  <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
    <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which </br >
        involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably </br >
        tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired </br >
        modem styles such as Twerking.</dd>
  <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have </br >
        discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants </br >
        of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this </br >
        because they were really cold.</dd> </br >
For more of my research, see my <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring">exotic dance research page.</a> </br ></br >

Yours sincerely. </br ></br ></br ></br ></br >
